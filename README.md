# Image-Flip-with-Text
FlipImage explores one aspect of image manipulation â€” image rotation. This app displays a square pane containing a single image presented in a 2x2 matrix. Using a set of up, down, left, and right arrows adjacent to each of the images the user may flip them vertically or horizontally.
